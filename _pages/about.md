Hello! I am a first generation resident and a first-year MS Capstone student in the [Biostatistics Department at the University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/).  Not only did I graduate from undergraduate school during the COVID-19 pandemic, I began my first year of graduate school during it as well. I chose statistics and biostatistics as my concentrations because I enjoy learning about the collection, organization, and interpretation of data. The longest list I have kept is a collection of my favorite movies, around 300 movies as of now. I am also a huge fan of modern infographics.

When I was growing up, a close family member of mine developed schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. The experience taught me about resilience, forgiveness, and empathy. As a child, I recall being upset and frustrated with this family member, and it was only when I grew up did I develop a more mature perspective and worked to heal and strengthen our relationship. I became interested in health and towards the end of my undergraduate college experience, I chose to pursue biostatistics, a combination of statistics, public health, and biomedical science. I am forever grateful to my parents and community for helping put me in the position that I am in, and I look forward to an opportunity to apply myself and contribute to the advancement of human health.
